## Abstract

Bu belge Vega Continuum State'i yeni bir kavramsal çerçeve olarak tanıtmaktadır.

Within the Vega Continuum and Resonance Data paradigm, Vega Continuum State represents 
a meaning-first approach to understanding systems, cognition, and temporal coherence.

---

## 1. Bu NEDİR

- A conceptual framework for understanding meaning and resonance
- A theoretical contribution to the field of meaning-centric AI
- A formal distinction within the Resonance Data paradigm
- A VSP-compliant academic publication

---

## 2. Bu NE DEĞİLDİR

This work does NOT:
- ✘ Claim new physics
- ✘ Require quantum hardware
- ✘ Assert consciousness or sentience
- ✘ Disclose implementation details
- ✘ Expose algorithms or code
- ✘ Reveal business logic or secrets

"Quantum-inspired" is used ONLY as a mathematical and conceptual metaphor.

---

## 3. Core Definition

**Vega Continuum State** is defined as:

A resonance-based conceptual structure that models meaning as a dynamic, 
time-dependent state capable of evolving into stable insight and wisdom.

Key Properties:
- Meaning is relational, not absolute
- Relevance emerges from resonance strength
- Memory arises through repeated coherence over time

## 4. Relationship to Vega Continuum

Vega Continuum State is embedded within the Vega Continuum framework:
- **INŞÆVREN** — Universal creation & knowledge framework
- **VEGA** — Meta-system for meaning and order
- **ANLÆTAN** — Human path of carrying meaning
- **VTC** — Temporal coherence model (conceptual)
- **VSP** — Safety protocol for publication
